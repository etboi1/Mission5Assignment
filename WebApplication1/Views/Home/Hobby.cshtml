    <!-- Cello -->

    <div class="card mb-4 shadow-sm">
        <div class="card-body">
            <h3 class="card-title mb-3">Cello</h3>

            <p class="card-text">
                I first began playing cello in the 5th grade. I always enjoyed it,
                but when I was accepted into the district orchestra in 7th grade,
                I discovered I was actually relatively good at the cello, which
                motivated me to take it more seriously. As I entered high school,
                I played in a full symphony for the first time, and that is when
                I really fell in love with music. To this day, I continue to play
                the cello in the BYU Philharmonic.

    <!-- Skiing -->
    <!-- Another card -->
    <div class="card mb-4 shadow-sm">
        <div class="card-body">
            <h3 class="card-title mb-3">Skiing</h3>

            <img src="~/skiing.jpg"
                 class="img-fluid rounded mb-3"
                 alt="Skiing" />

            <p class="card-text">
                Unlike playing the cello, I did not begin skiing until after I
                returned from my mission, when I was 21. The first season—starting
                with a powder day of over 1.5 feet—almost made me regret buying a
                pass because of how bad I was. Now skiing is one of my favorite
                hobbies, although this season’s snow is making me question that
                decision again.
